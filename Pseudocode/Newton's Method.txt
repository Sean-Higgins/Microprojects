Newton's Method for Approximating the Zeros of a Function

Let f(c) = 0, where f is differentiable on an open interval containing c.
Then, to approximate c, use the following steps.

1. Make an initial estimate x(1) that is close to c. (A graph is helpful for this step.)

2. Determine a new approximation

	x(n+1) = x(n) - [f(x(n))/f'(x(n))]

3. If |x(n) - x(n+1)| is within the desired accuracy, let x(n+1) serve as
   the final approximation. Otherwise, return to Step 2 and calculate a new
   approximation.

Each successive application of this procedure is called an iteration.
