Newton's Method Algorithm Pseudocode

Output "Please enter the function you want to approximate the critical values of: f(x) ="
Input function

Output "Please enter your initial estimate of x that is close to the function's critical value:"
Input x1

Output "And finally, please enter the ammount you want your final two estimates to differ by:"
Input valueDifference

Set iterations to 0
