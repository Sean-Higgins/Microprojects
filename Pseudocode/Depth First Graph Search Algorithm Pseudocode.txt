Depth-First Graph Search Algorithm

DepthFirstSearch(startVertex, endVertex)
Set found to FALSE
Push(myStack, startVertex)
WHILE (NOT isEmpty(myStack) AND NOT FOUND)
	Pop(myStack, tempVertex)
	IF (tempVertex equals endVertex)
		Output endVertex
		Set found to TRUE
	ELSE IF (!!!tempVertex not visited!!!)
		Output tempVertex
		!!!Push all unvisited vertices adjacent with tempVertex!!!
		!!!Mark tempVertex as visited!!!	//A vertex is marked as visited once all its
IF (found)						//adjacent vertices have been pushed onto the stack.
	Output "Path has been printed"
ELSE
	Output "Path does not exist"
