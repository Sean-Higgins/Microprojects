Boolian Binary Search Algorithm Pseudocode

Set data to [ant, cat, chicken, cow, deer, dog, fish, goat, horse, rat, snake]
Set length to data.length

Set first to 0
Set last to length - 1
Set found to FALSE

WHILE (first <= last AND NOT found)
	Set middle to (first + last)/2
	IF (item equals data[middle]0
		Set found to TRUE
	ELSE
		IF (item < data[middle])
			Set last to middle - 1
		ELSE
			Set first to middle + 1
Return found
