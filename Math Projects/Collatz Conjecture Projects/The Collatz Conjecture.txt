The Collatz Conjecture:
	 Consider the following operation on an arbitrary positive integer(n):
		- If the number is even, divide it by two.
		- If the number is odd, triple it and add one.

	The function in terms of n [f(n)] is as follows:

			{ n/2	if n % 2 = 0
	f(n) =	{
			{ 3n+1	if n % 2 = 1.

	Now, form a sequence by performing this opperation repeatedly, beginning
	with any positive integer, and taking the result at each step as the input
	at the next.

	In notation:

				{ n			for i = 0
	a(sub i) =	{
				{ f(a(sub i-1))	for i > 0

	(that is: a(sub i) is the value of f applied to n recursively i times;
		a(sub i) = f^i(n)).

	The Collatz Conjecture is as follows: This process will eventually reach
	the number 1, regardless of which positive integer is chosen initially.

	The smallest i such that a(sub i) = 1 is called the Total Stopping Time of n. The
	conjecture asserts that every n has a well-defined total stopping time. If, for
	some n, such an i doesn't exist, we say that n has infinite total stopping time
	and the conjecture is false.

	If the conjecture is false, it can only be because there is some starting number
	which gives rise to a sequence that does not contain 1. Such a sequence might enter
	a repeating cycle that excludes 1, or increase without bound.

	No such sequence has been found.
