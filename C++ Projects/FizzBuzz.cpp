/*
 * FizzBuzz.cpp
 *
 * A C++ program to demonstrate a classic programming problem, FizzBuzz!
 *
 * The rules of FizzBuzz:
 * For the numbers from 1 to 100, print out the words Fizz, Buzz, and FizzBuzz based on the following rules:
 * If a number is divisible by 3, print out the word Fizz.
 * If a number is divisible by 5, print out the word Buzz.
 * If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5 (i.e. 15), print out both Fizz and Buzz (i.e. FizzBuzz).
